The Props interface is defined but not used within the WalletPage component. This is unnecessary and can lead to confusion.

The children variable is destructured from props but not used within the component. This is an unused variable and adds unnecessary clutter to the code.

The sortedBalances array is computed using useMemo, but the sorting function is not efficient. It sorts the balances multiple times using the getPriority function, which can be optimized.

The useMemo hook depends on both balances and prices, but it only lists balances as a dependency. This can lead to incorrect behavior if prices change.

In the getPriority function, there is a variable balancePriority used, but it is never defined. It should be leftPriority.

Inside the sortedBalances filter function, there is a check if (lhsPriority > -99) which will always be true since you are using balancePriority.

The sortedBalances array is mapped to formattedBalances and then mapped again to create rows. This can be optimized to avoid unnecessary iterations.

When using map to render components, it's better to use a unique identifier as the key instead of the array index. This can improve component reusability and performance.
